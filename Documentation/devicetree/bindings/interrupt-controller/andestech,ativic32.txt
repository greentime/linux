* Andestech Internal Vector Interrupt Controller

The Internal Vector Interrupt Controller (IVIC) is a basic interrupt controller
suitable for a simpler SoC platform not requiring a more sophisticated and
bigger External Vector Interrupt Controller.


Main node required properties:

- compatible : should at least contain  "andestech,ativic32".
- interrupt-parent: Empty for the interrupt controller itself
- interrupt-controller : Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells: The number of cells to define the interrupts. Should be 2.
	The first cell is the IRQ number
	The second cell is used to specify mode:
		1 = low-to-high edge triggered
		2 = high-to-low edge triggered
		4 = active high level-sensitive
		8 = active low level-sensitive
		Default for internal sources should be set to 4 (active high).

Examples:
	intc: interrupt-controller {
		compatible = "andestech,ativic32";
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
		interrupt-controller;
	};
